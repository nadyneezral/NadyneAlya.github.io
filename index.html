        <h2>Who am I ?</h2>
        <h6>05092018</h6>
        <p>Let me introuduce myself first. My name is Nadyne Alya. I am turning twelve this year. I was born at Hospital Kelantan at 06/12/2006. I am a homeschooler. But my first grade and second grade I was in school. Intergration school. I started be a homeschooler when I reach third grade.Until now, I'm still a homeschooler. So I have been homeschool for three years now.I use Khan Academy since I started homeschool.I choose to learn programming because I think it is fun! </p>
        
        <h2>What am I doing at Khan Academy.</h2>
<p>I am learning JavaScript and HTML and CSS. I just finish JavaScript last month. Now I am doing HTML and CSS. I use to learn it <em>everyday .</em> Because it is fun! Every morning after my subh prayer, I read a book. At least five pages. Then I do this. At least one hour a day. But sometimes I do like thirty minutes in the morning and in the afternoon. For my breakfast, I love to make hot chocolate and bring it into the desktop room. So while learning I drink my breakfast. After I done my work, then I would like to eat rice or a proper breakfast. Cause if I eat heavy food, I will be so sleepy when I learning.</p>
        

            <h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p>JavaScript is a programming but it is more on drawing and animation. JavaScript has hundred and five to learn. It took me a long time to finish it. It is quite challenging. Really challenging me. I was really happy when I can finish it. </p>
        

            <h2>HTML and CSS</h2>
<P> HTML and CSS is more on writing. It is like we learning how to do a website or blog. I love this because I love blogging and now I learn how to make a blog by yourself not like the wordpress or blogspot or wix and there is more but we create a blog or website with our own desing. It is fun!  HTML and CSS is not as much as JavaScript. It only has fifty three to learn. But the important thing is it is fun. Really fun to make our own blog.</P>
